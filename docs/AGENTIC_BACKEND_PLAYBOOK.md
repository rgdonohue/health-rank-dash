# 🛠 Agentic Backend Playbook v0.2 (Experimental)

**For AI-Augmented Development of Data Pipelines, APIs, and Stateful Systems**

---

## 🔍 Why This Playbook Exists

This revision fuses hard-won lessons from *Tilecraft*, *No-SQL Atlas*, and the HealthRankDash documentation experiment **plus** practical operational patterns we've developed. It adds:

* Practical prompt templates for tricky backend logic
* Explicit guidance on LLM failure modes & mitigation
* Prompt versioning + provenance tracking
* Working fallback patterns with tests
* Expanded testing techniques beyond unit coverage

**Use as experimental protocol—not proven methodology.**

## ⚠️ **Critical Limitations & Context**

**This playbook is based primarily on one failed project (N=1).** These patterns may not generalize beyond our specific context:

- **Domain**: Health data dashboard with unfamiliar data structures
- **Timeline**: Rapid prototyping under time pressure  
- **AI Model**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet with specific prompting patterns
- **Team**: Single developer with particular working style

**Before applying these patterns:**
- Validate against your specific domain and constraints
- Consider that research shows AI-assisted development requires significant human iteration regardless of architecture complexity
- Recognize that our failure may have been over-engineering, not methodology

**Missing validation:** We need evidence from multiple projects, different domains, and varied team structures before claiming universal validity.

## 📚 **Research Context & Contradictions**

### Current AI Development Research Findings

**Our assumptions vs. industry research:**

#### AI Team Integration
- **Our claim**: "AI as junior teammate with clear boundaries"
- **Research reality**: Forrester predicts that organizations attempting to replace 50%+ of development teams with AI are likely to fail, highlighting fundamental misunderstanding of developer roles
- **Implication**: Our workflow may still over-rely on AI autonomy

#### Development Iteration Patterns  
- **Our observation**: Complex architecture led to failure
- **Research finding**: AI-assisted coding requires substantial human review and iteration regardless of architecture complexity
- **Alternative hypothesis**: The iteration overhead is inherent to AI development, not caused by our architecture choices

#### Developer Role Evolution
- **Industry trend**: Hybrid AI-human approaches showing better results than AI-first or human-first extremes
- **Our gap**: We focused on methodology when the issue may have been insufficient domain expertise

## 🧱 Experimental Principles

**Note:** These principles worked in our specific case but may not apply universally.

### 1. **AI ≠ Engineer—It's a Junior Dev With Memory Issues**

Current research shows AI-assisted development requires substantial human review and iteration, regardless of architecture complexity. Don't expect AI to work autonomously even with "clear boundaries."

**LLM Fragility Warning:** Even with perfect prompts, agents frequently:
- Lose cross-file context  
- Forget schema fields  
- Hallucinate glue code

*Mitigate through narrow prompts, staged commits, and compulsory human review.*

### 2. **Domain Understanding Trumps Methodology**

Our failure wasn't documentation—it was trying to architect a complex system without understanding the problem domain first. The 114-line solution worked because it focused on solving an actual user need.

### 3. **Backend Must Be Decomposed Into Independent Stages**

Break complex workflows into stages that can be prompted, tested, and validated independently. This worked in our case but may not suit all architectures.

### 4. **Working Prototype First**

Build something that works for users before optimizing architecture. This aligns with lean startup methodology and agile practices.

### 5. **Log Everything the Agent Touches (Prompt ⇄ Output)**

Track prompt versions and outputs for debugging and improvement. This proved essential in our workflow but adds overhead.

## 🎯 What We Missed (Critical Additions)

### User Validation
- **Before coding**: Talk to actual users to understand the real problem
- **During development**: Test prototypes with users regularly
- **After building**: Measure actual usage patterns, not just technical metrics

### Hybrid AI-Human Workflow
- Research shows hybrid approaches work better than AI-first or human-first extremes
- Plan for multiple iteration cycles between AI generation and human refinement
- Don't expect linear progress—AI development is inherently iterative

### Middle Ground Architecture
- Between hack solution and over-engineering lies **incremental architecture**
- Start simple, refactor when complexity is actually needed
- Use [Martin Fowler's refactoring patterns](https://refactoring.com/) rather than upfront design

### Evidence-Based Decisions
- Test these patterns on multiple projects before claiming validity
- Compare against teams using different approaches
- Measure outcomes, not just process compliance

## 🔃 Experimental Backend Workflow

**⚠️ Context**: This staged approach worked in our specific case but may not suit all project types.

| Stage                            | AI Goal                            | Human Prep                      | Mandatory Artifact                              |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Schema**                    | Draft strict Pydantic model        | Provide sample CSV or JSON      | `schema/health_ind.py` + `test_schema.py`       |
| **2. Processor**                 | Transform & validate a record      | Seed failing tests first        | `processors/normalize.py` + `test_normalize.py` |
| **3. Integration**               | Expose FastAPI endpoint            | Review dependencies, DI pattern | `integration/api.py` + `test_api.py`            |
| **4. Observability & Fallbacks** | Add structured logging & safe-mode | Specify failure scenarios       | `fallbacks/default_processor.py` + fault tests  |
| **5. Docs**                      | Auto-summarise modules             | Approve & trim output           | Updated `README.md`                             |

### Example Prompt Template – Complex Conditional Logic

```yaml
id: processor_normalize_v1
version: 1.0.0
role: "You are a Python backend developer."
task: |
  Write `normalize_obesity_rate(record)` that:
  1. Converts rate strings like "23%" to float 0.23.
  2. If value is "NA" or empty, return `None` **and** log soft error.
  3. If value >1, assume it's already a fraction.
inputs:
  - schema: HealthIndicator (see attached Pydantic model)
output_contract: "Must pass tests in test_normalize.py"
logging: "Use logger named 'health.processor'"
```

### Prompt Failure-Mode Checklist

* Max 400 tokens
* Explicit success criteria
* Link only **one** external file via snippet, not full repo
* Require a log line on exceptions

## 🏷️ Prompt Versioning & Provenance (Complexity-Dependent)

### 🎯 When Is This Overhead Worth It?

**Use Full Tracking When:**
- Multiple developers using shared prompts
- Production system with AI-generated code
- Long-term project with evolving requirements
- Need to debug/audit AI generation issues
- Compliance or reproducibility requirements

**Use Simpler Approach When:**
- Single developer, short timeline
- Prototyping or proof-of-concept
- Low-stakes application
- Clear understanding of the domain

### 🔹 Full Tracking (For Complex Projects)

1. **ID Tagging** — every YAML prompt has `id` and `version` fields
2. **Hash Comment** — AI-generated files receive `# prompt:processor_normalize_v1@1.0.0` header
3. **Prompt Log** — store prompt + completion in `logs/prompts/YYYYMMDD.jsonl`
4. **Drift Check CI** — nightly job compares file headers to latest prompt versions and flags drift

### 🔹 Lightweight Tracking (For Simple Projects)

1. **Simple Comments** — Add `# Generated by AI: [date]` to AI-created files
2. **Version Control** — Git commit messages noting AI assistance
3. **Basic Log** — Keep successful prompts in a simple text file
4. **Manual Review** — Human approval before merging AI code (no automation)

## 🔄 Fallback Patterns (Complexity-Dependent)

### 🎯 When Do You Need Fallbacks?

**Implement Fallbacks When:**
- Production data processing systems
- AI-generated code handles user data
- System must remain operational during AI failures
- Batch processing large datasets

**Skip Fallbacks When:**
- Development/testing environments
- Interactive applications where failures are visible
- Simple CRUD operations
- Clear error messages are sufficient

### Default Pass-Through Processor (Template)

```python
# fallbacks/default_processor.py
from typing import Any, Dict

def default_processor(record: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Return record unchanged; attach fallback metadata."""
    record["_status"] = "FALLBACK"
    return record
```

**When to Trigger**: processor raises unhandled error **or** validation fails.

### Testing Fallback

```python
# test_fallback.py
from fallbacks.default_processor import default_processor

def test_fallback_adds_status():
    rec = {"county": "Adams", "rate": "NA"}
    assert default_processor(rec)["_status"] == "FALLBACK"
```

Fallbacks keep the pipeline running and provide traceable hydration for later re-processing.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy (Expanded)

**Context**: This multi-layered approach worked well in our case but may be excessive for smaller projects.

1. **Contract-First Unit Tests** (required before AI code merge)
2. **Property-Based Tests** using `hypothesis` for schema edge cases
3. **Integration Tests** spin up FastAPI with `TestClient`
4. **Observability Assertions** Parse structured log JSON to assert error paths
5. **Performance Tests** `ab -n 100 -c 10` latency target <500 ms median

> **AI-Generated vs Human-Refined** Allow AI to scaffold tests, but humans must add at least two edge cases before commit.

---

## 📘 Documentation Strategy (Context-Specific Lessons)

### 🎯 What Went Wrong In Our Case

Our extensive upfront documentation (25KB before functional code) created cognitive overhead that slowed our specific workflow. **This doesn't mean documentation is bad**—it means our approach was wrong for:
- Single developer rapid prototyping
- Unfamiliar domain (health data)  
- AI-assisted development with high iteration cycles

### 🔹 Context-Dependent Documentation Needs

**For Small/Rapid Projects** (like ours):
* **README** — Setup and basic usage
* **API Contracts** — Just the essential endpoints
* **Decisions Log** — Why we chose specific approaches (brief)

**For Team/Long-term Projects**:
* Standard agile documentation practices
* Comprehensive API documentation
* Architecture decision records
* User stories and acceptance criteria

**For AI-Assisted Development Specifically**:
* Prompt templates and examples
* Known failure modes and workarounds
* Human review checkpoints

### 🔹 Documentation Timing Lessons

- **Our mistake**: Comprehensive planning docs before understanding the problem
- **Better approach**: Document what you learn as you build working solutions
- **Key insight**: AI development iteration cycles may require different documentation timing than traditional development

## 🧪 Metrics + Measurement

### Quantitative Tracking (from MEASUREMENT\_METHODOLOGY.md)

#### Time-Based Metrics

* **Setup Time** → Git timestamp analysis
* **Time-to-First-Test-Pass**
* **Debug Cycle Duration** → From failure to green test

#### Output Quality

* **Test Coverage** → `pytest --cov`
* **Code Complexity** → `radon`
* **Security** → `safety check`
* **Performance** → `curl`, `ab`, `lighthouse`

#### AI Cognitive Load

* **Questions Asked / Feature**
* **Context Tokens Used**
* **Prompt Length / Effectiveness Ratio**

#### Process Compliance

* **Commit Activity**
* **Semantic Git Messages**
* **Churn Metrics** → `git diff --stat`

### Outcome-Focused Metrics

**Beyond process metrics, measure actual results:**

#### User Impact
* **Time to User Value** → From start to working prototype in user hands
* **User Problem Resolution** → Does it actually solve the stated problem?
* **Adoption Rate** → Do users choose this over alternatives?

#### Development Effectiveness  
* **Feature Completion Rate** → Working features vs. started features
* **Architectural Churn** → How often do we rewrite core components?
* **Technical Debt Velocity** → Rate of accumulation vs. resolution

### Comparative Analysis Protocol

Instead of isolated A/B testing:
* Compare against industry benchmarks for similar projects
* Track multiple teams using different approaches
* Measure both short-term velocity and long-term maintainability

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls (From Our Experience)

**Context**: These issues appeared in our specific workflow - may not apply to all AI-assisted development.

* **Single-Shot Pipeline Prompts** → hallucinated modules & circular imports
* **Skipping Drift Checks** → silent prompt-file divergence
* **Test-After-The-Fact** → flaky or missing coverage
* **Overloaded Context Windows** → reduced AI precision
* **Relying on AI for Async/Threading** → deadlocks & brittle code—hand-code or heavily constrain
* **Documentation-As-Obstacle** → time sink with no velocity gain
* **AI Writing Logging/Config Before Logic** → wasted effort

---

## 🧭 Evolution Strategy (Experimental)

**Context**: These monitoring approaches worked in our case but require validation across different project types.

* **Weekly Metric Review** via dashboard + CI comment
* **Quarterly Prompt Audit** rotate temperature, compare deltas
* **Documentation Budget** Auto-warn when MVD grows >4 KB
* **Agent Specialization** Introduce separate model for schema design if processor accuracy <90%
* **Drift Monitoring** Embed quality gates via CI for test, coverage, lint, and semantic commit enforcement

## Final Word: Promising Experimental Patterns

**This playbook represents patterns from limited project experience.** The operational techniques (prompt versioning, fallbacks, staged workflows) showed promise in our case, but the prescriptive guidance should be treated as **hypotheses to test**, not proven methodology.

### Practical Elements That Seemed Effective
- **Prompt versioning & provenance tracking** for debugging AI generation issues
- **Fallback patterns** for maintaining system stability when AI logic fails
- **Staged workflow with clear artifacts** for managing complex AI-assisted development
- **Working prototype first** (aligns with proven lean/agile practices)
- **AI requires significant human iteration** (supported by current research)

### Critical Limitations & Needs Validation
- **Single project basis (N=1)** - patterns may not generalize
- **Specific context** (health data, single developer, rapid timeline)
- **Operational overhead** - tracking may be excessive for simpler projects
- **Alternative explanations** - our failure may have been domain knowledge, not methodology

### Recommended Approach
1. **Try the operational patterns** (versioning, fallbacks, staged workflow) in your context
2. **Measure outcomes** vs. your current AI-assisted development approach
3. **Adapt based on your specific constraints** (team size, project complexity, timeline)
4. **Contribute back findings** to validate or refute these patterns across different contexts

**Use as experimental toolkit—test what works for your situation, discard what doesn't.**

Backend-heavy AI-assisted development can work, but requires careful human oversight at every integration point. These patterns are guardrails for experimentation, not universal solutions.
